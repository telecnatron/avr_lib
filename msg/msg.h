 * 
 * @brief  A very simple messaging system for sending and receiving messages, via
 * the UART for example. 
 * 
 * When present in the bootloader section, these functions can be called from
 * the application section. To enable this functionallity, ensure that BOOT_APP 
 * is defined when compiling msg.c
 *
 * The message consists of:<UL>
 *    <LI>Start of message byte (character) as defined by MSG_SOM</LI>
 *    <LI>Message length byte, max 256</LI>
 *    <LI>The message's data bytes</LI>
 *    <LI>End of message byte as defined by MSG_EOM</LI>
 * </UL>
 * 
 * Invalid messages are silently ignored and the system will reset back to waiting
 * for a new message.
 * An invalid message can be caused by the end-of-message character not being received 
 * when expected, or by a timeout occuring before a completed message has being received.
 *
 * To provide for timing, the msg_tick() function should be called periodically, and when
 * used with MSG_TIMEOUT_TICKS (defined in msg.c) set the timout period. 
 * With MSG_TIMEOUT_TICKS=8 and calling msg_tick() every 250ms, the timeout value is 2 seconds.
 *
 * When a message is received, the user provided callback function is called to allow access to
 * the message. The callback function has the following signature:
 *
 *   void handler(struct msg_t *msg)
 *
 * And is passed a point to a msg_t structure. msg->buf contains the message data, and msg->len
 * is the message length.
 *
