 * 
 * @brief  A very simple messaging system for sending and receiving messages, via
 * the UART for example. 
 * 
 * When present in the bootloader section, these functions can be called from
 * the application section. To enable this functionallity, ensure that BOOT_APP 
 * is defined when compiling msg.c
 *
 * The message consists of bytes (uint8_t) being:<UL>
 *    <LI>Start of message byte (character) as defined by MSG_SOM</LI>
 *    <LI>Message length byte, max 256</LI>
 *    <LI>The message's data bytes</LI>
 *    <LI>Checksum byte being the value that sums the len and data bytes to 0</LI>
 * </UL>
 * 
 * Invalid messages are silently ignored and the system will reset back to waiting
 * for a new message.
 * An invalid message can be caused by the chend-of-message character not being received 
 * when expected, or by a timeout occuring before a completed message has being received.
 *
 * To provide for timing, the <b>msg_tick()</b> function should be called periodically, and when
 * used with MSG_TIMEOUT_TICKS  set the timout period. 
 * With MSG_TIMEOUT_TICKS=8 and calling <b>msg_tick()</b> every 250ms, the timeout value is 2 seconds.
 *
 * When a message is received, the user provided callback function is called which gives access to
 * the message. The callback function has the following signature:<code>
 *
 *   void handler(struct msg_t *msg)
 *</code>
 * It is passed a pointer to a msg_t structure. msg->data contains the message data bytes, and msg->len
 * is the message length byte.
 *
 * The <code>msg_rx_char()</code> function is used by the application to pass a received byte from the HOST
 * (eg via UART) into the msg system.
 *
 * The msg_send() function is used to send a message back to the HOST. It is passed a pointer to a function
 * that does the actual sending.
